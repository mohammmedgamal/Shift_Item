# Deployment & Git Rules for Ghazlan Shift Duties

## Repository Information
- **Main Repository**: https://github.com/mohammmedgamal/Shift_Item.git
- **Main Branch**: `main`

## Git Workflow
When asked to "deploy", "push", or "update GitHub", always follow these steps:
1. **Check Status**: Run `git status` to see what has changed.
2. **Add Changes**: Run `git add .` (respecting `.gitignore`).
3. **Commit**: Use a descriptive commit message that summarizes the changes.
   - Format: `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `docs: ...`, `refactor: ...`
4. **Push**: Run `git push origin main`.

## Project Structure
- `client/`: React frontend (Vite)
- `server/`: Node.js/Express backend
- `package.json`: Root manager for Railway/deployment
- `database.sqlite`: **NEVER** push this file (managed by .gitignore).

## Railway Deployment Reminders
- The root `package.json` contains a `railway-build` script for deployment.
- Static files are served from `client/dist` by the backend.
- Ensure the Railway project is linked to the GitHub repository.
- Use `npm run railway-build` if manual building is needed.
- The app uses `process.env.PORT` provided by Railway.
